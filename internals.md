# Distribution

Regolith is a set of Ubuntu packages distributed via two "Private Package Repositories" (PPA):

| Repository | URL | Purpose |
| [Regolith Stable](https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-stable) | https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-stable | Primary repository for Regolith packages |
| [Regolith Unstable](https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-unstable) | https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/regolith-unstable | Pre-release versions of Regolith packages. Not recommended for everyday use of Regolith. |

# Hacking

## Configuration

Colors and fonts can be changed in Regolith by updating your Xresource values.  The primary Xresources file that Regolith uses is `/etc/regolith/styles/root`.  To customize them, copy that file to `~/.Xresources-regolith`.  After logging back in your new settings should take effect.

### Colors

Color values can be selected by toggling the `#includes` in your Regolith Xresources file.  Lines in Xresources are commented if `!` is the first character of the line.

## Packaging

All deployable aspects of Regolith Linux are expressed via debian packages.  These packages are available in source form on the [Regolith Linux Github project](https://github.com/regolith-linux).  Creating packages is not necessary to change the look and feel of Regolith, however there are advantages to packaging changes.  More easily sharing changes, ability to have a common configuration across machines, automatic updates, and a clean versioning strategy are all advantages to using a packaging system.
